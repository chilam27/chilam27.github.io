# Dao Chi's Data Science Portfolio: [chilam27.github.io](chilam27.github.io)

This repository is where I host my new data science portfolio, where I display all my skills, experiences, education, and completed projects. 

A huge thanks to [Chanin Nantasenamat](https://github.com/dataprofessor) (Data Professor) for his [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mEZ1Hj5yQ-8) that exposed me to [Hugo](https://hugothemesfree.com/) and guided me through the basics steps on how to build an online portfolio. And credit goes to [Emruz Hossain](https://github.com/hossainemruz) for building the themes that I used as my template. The template can be viewed [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/toha/).

My last portfolio can be viewed [here](https://chilam27.github.io/Chi_Portfolio/). I decided to move to this new one because I prefer the layout and design on this theme better, especially its infinite scroll layout.
