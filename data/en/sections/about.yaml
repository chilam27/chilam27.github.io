# a summary about you
summary: 'I am obsessed with turning raw data into beneficial and profitable knowledge!


Not only it has become my lifestyle, by evaluating my past schedule to create a more balanced life or analyzing spending habits so I can reach my financial targets faster, I also helped organizations and people around me achieve their goals using data!


By incorporating my new data management and data analysis methods into a sale strategy, I helped boost a company’s sales by 8%. During my time as a research assistant, I built machine learning models to predict student’s admission rates and identified contributing factors so the school can better assist them.


As a result of the obsession, I adopted optimization as my new value and apply it to many works that I do. I strongly believe that it is a powerful weapon that will create positive impacts on many people and businesses.'
